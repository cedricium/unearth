# unearth

**saved posts management app**

The idea for unearth came from wanting a solution to saving hundreds of
posts across various sites but forgetting to ever look at them again. And I'm
not the only one who does this:
[see this thread on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/41t87f/dae_use_the_save_feature_on_reddit_and_then_never/).

What's the point of saving something if you plan on never looking at it later?

That's where unearth comes into play: it is a centralized application to
manage saved posts from various sites / services. Users of unearth will be
able to view and delete saved posts from these services directly from the app -
with no need to leave the app to actually view the saved content.

Similarly, unearth helps you discover and manage those seemingly lost and long
forgotten posts you saved.
